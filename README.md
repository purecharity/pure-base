# Installation

IMPORTANT:  At this time the plugin requires a name change after extracting from Github.  After downloading the source code from Github unzip the files and rename the folder **/purecharity-wp-base** and compress as **purecharity-wp-base.zip** if you plan to use the Wordpress plugin installer via upload.   

In order to install the plugin:

1. Copy the `/purecharity-wp-base` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins` on your WP install
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set your credentials at the `Settings > PureBase Settings` in your admin left menu
4. You're done!
